## Project Description
I created a simple calculator project, using the Tkinter library. The Tkinter library is built-in with every Python installation. This calculator will help us to do simple calculations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. I use three functions, the first is button_press() which is used to get input in the form of button clicks and enters numbers into calculations, the second function is equals() which is used for the calculation process, specifically the calculation process is carried out by the built-in python function, namely eval() . The third function I created is clear() which is used to clear the calculation results
